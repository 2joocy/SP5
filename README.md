# Errors and Issues
Reason why the last exam project isn't finished, is due to frustrations with different errors. I had a issue with my Entity Managers at once. I restarted Netbeans, and the error went away, but wouldn't display my JSON when doing a GET request. I tried restarting netbeans again, and I get a ClassNotFound exception on my Persistance dependencies. I restart it again, and now MYSQL tells me that I have a The server time zone value 'Rom, normaltid' is unrecognized exception... All these errors happened without changing ANY code at all. All I did was restart netbeans 4-5 times. I have given up on this issue, after staying up all night trying to resolve this. My stupidity, by staying up from 11 Pm to 8 Am left me not being able to attend the guidance class today.
